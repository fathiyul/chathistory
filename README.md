# chathistory

`chathistory` is a terminal tool for browsing local AI coding session history and exporting shareable HTML or PDF transcripts.

Right now the project supports `Codex` session logs under `~/.codex/sessions/`. `Claude Code` and `OpenCode` are planned later.

## Features

- Browse session files in a terminal UI
- Preview USER and ASSISTANT messages with lightweight formatting
- Export transcripts as styled HTML
- Export PDF through headless Chrome
- Add title, tags, and transcript detail controls at export time

## Installation

Requirements:

- Python `>=3.13`
- `uv`
- `google-chrome` available locally for PDF export

Install globally:

```bash
uv tool install .
```

During local development, reinstall after changes:

```bash
uv tool install --reinstall .
```

## Usage

Run the main app:

```bash
chathistory
```

This opens the terminal browser for the main workflow: browse sessions, preview chats, configure export options, and generate HTML or PDF output.

Run the direct renderer when you already know the file and flags you want:

```bash
chathistory-codex input.jsonl
```

By default, exports are written to the directory where you run the command unless you set `--output`. If you set a title, the default filename follows that title with filesystem-safe sanitizing.

## Terminal Browser

This is the primary interface and the main purpose of the project.

Launch it with:

```bash
chathistory
```

### Flow

1. Choose a provider (`Codex` works now)
2. Navigate inside `~/.codex/sessions/` with arrow keys
3. Open a `.jsonl` file to preview the conversation
4. Press `Enter` again to configure export options
5. Generate HTML or PDF, then return to the browser

### Controls

- `↑` / `↓` — move selection
- `Enter` — open folder, preview file, or confirm action
- `Esc` — go back / close preview / quit current screen
- `Backspace` or `←` — go up one directory
- `Home` entry — return to provider selection
- `PgUp` / `PgDn` — scroll preview faster

### Preview behavior

- Shows only USER and ASSISTANT messages
- Consecutive USER messages collapse to only the last one, matching the exported transcript flow
- USER text is tinted light pink; ASSISTANT text is white

## Direct Renderer

`chathistory-codex` is the lower-level export tool. Think of it like `ffmpeg`: less guided, more direct, and good for scripting or one-shot conversions.

Run it with:

```bash
chathistory-codex input.jsonl
```

If no input is given, it automatically picks the latest file under `~/.codex/sessions/`.

### Common examples

Generate HTML:

```bash
chathistory-codex input.jsonl
```

Generate PDF:

```bash
chathistory-codex input.jsonl --pdf
```

Set title and tags:

```bash
chathistory-codex input.jsonl --title "Belajar Auth" --tags "auth, backend"
```

Include richer internal records:

```bash
chathistory-codex input.jsonl --full --include-turn-context --include-events
```

### Flags

- `input` — path to a session `.jsonl`; defaults to the latest session
- `-o`, `--output` — output path; defaults to a sanitized version of the title, or the session filename if no title is set
- `--chrome-path` — Chrome/Chromium binary used for PDF rendering; defaults to `google-chrome` or `CHROME_BIN`
- `--title` — custom document title shown in the transcript header
- `--tags` — comma-separated tags shown under the header metadata
- `--pdf` — write PDF instead of HTML
- `--plaintext` — disable markdown-like styling for USER and ASSISTANT text
- `--keep-html` — keep the intermediate HTML at the given path when exporting PDF
- `--collapse-threshold` — collapse USER/ASSISTANT entries longer than this many lines in HTML
- `--collapse-lines` — visible lines when collapsed; clamped so it never exceeds `--collapse-threshold`
- `--full` — include developer messages, tool calls, tool outputs, and other non-essential records
- `--include-turn-context` — include turn-context records when `--full` is enabled
- `--include-events` — include low-level event records when `--full` is enabled

## Development

Run from the repo without installing globally:

```bash
uv run python cli.py
uv run python codex.py input.jsonl
```

## Output notes

- Browser tab title is fixed to `chathistory`
- Local file references like `[PRD.md](/path/to/PRD.md#L21)` render as non-clickable blue text like `PRD.md:21`
- HTML output supports collapsing long USER and ASSISTANT messages
- PDF output always renders fully expanded content
- Chrome's default PDF URL/date header is suppressed; page numbering remains

## Repository layout

- `cli.py` — terminal browser and export workflow
- `codex.py` — direct renderer and shared export logic
- `assets/` — static assets such as the browser-tab icon
